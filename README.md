A RESTful interface to interact with the backend services.

## To-do ðŸ“œ

- [ ] Create `Articles` table
- [ ] CRUD on `/articles` endpoint
- [ ] Add responses example in the docs page
- [ ] Meaningful message when client error emitted
- [ ] Feature to provide solutions to skin diseases
- [ ] CRUD Skin Dieseases
- [ ] Update response status code
- [x] Add request query to docs
- [ ] To `POST` an article, user must attach the `thumbnailId`. Therefore, user either upload a new thumbnail first to get a `thumbnailId`, or retrieve one of the available thumbnail. Cuz you cannot send these two types of request simultaneously
